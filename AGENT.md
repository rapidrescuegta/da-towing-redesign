# AGENT.md — D&A Towing Site

<!--
  This file is the agent's persistent identity + memory.
  Two zones, hard split:
    ZONE 1 — IDENTITY: Osminog-managed. Agent MUST NOT edit. Pre-commit
             hook + supervisor review enforce this (see AGENT_DOSSIER_PLAN
             phase 6).
    ZONE 2 — KNOWLEDGE: agent-managed. Append + summarize freely. Cap
             ~2000 lines; soft warn at 1500.
-->
